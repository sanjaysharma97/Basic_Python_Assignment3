    "# 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- Functions are something which can reduce code duplication and manual effort.If we write a code or program without using function we have to perform the same tasks multiple times so function came in to avoid duplication of code and effort.\n",
    ">Reducing duplication of code.\n",
    ">Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces.\n",
    ">Improving clarity of the code.\n",
    "> Reuse of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- When it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- A function is created with the def keyword in python.The def keyword is followed by the function name with parenthesis and a colon.\n",
    ">def test():\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- A function is a block of code that does a particular work and returns a result.E.g- def mul(a,b):\n",
    "                                                                                              return a*b\n",
    "\n",
    "  A function call is the code used to pass control to a function.\n",
    "  E.g- z=mul(5,9)\n",
    "       now z will have the value 45.\n",
    "     While function call is using function to achieve that task.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "# 5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- There is one global and one local scopes in a python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- The local scope is destroyed and variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- Whenever function is called it returns a result to us and we say that function is evaluated.Yes it is possible to have a return value in an expression but avoid the complex ones because it's difficult to understand the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- It's return value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- By use global keyword we make a function variable refer to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- The data type of None is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- The import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- This function can be called by spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- By using error handling and logging in python we can put an error inside try and except block to save a programme from crashing it and  it should throw an error message instead of crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER- The purpose of the try clause is to test a block of code for errors.The except block lets you handle the error.\n",
